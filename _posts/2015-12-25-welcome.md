![That's me being photographed.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/56ec460b1794d8d9901761fd1de9d26833ab4782.jpg)

This is Raphi's test website. I'm a photographer, and working on several sustainability projects. With this website I want to try out and support the AI aspect of web design.

As a photographer I document events in a high quality and with an artistic aspect. That includes: talks, discussions, presentations, parties and other meetings.

Personally I'm interested in all aspects of photography, and shoot whatever comes to mind and has some artistic value for myself. That contains nature, micro, landscapes, street, architecture, portraits and more.

Let's explore this exciting development! :-)

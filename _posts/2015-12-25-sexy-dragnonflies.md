description: "  Sexy Dragonflies  I discovered them a few weeks ago in the Irchel Park near the University of Zurich. There is this pond I visited regularly and often saw them flying around in the summer looking for food.  Amazingly I could get extremely close, without disturbing them, so I kept shooting and even had the time to get the micro flash on and take a few shots. Unfortunately I didn't bring a tripod. That would have made things a lot easier...   How I shot D750, 105mm micro 2.8, between 1/250 and 1/400 sec, f/9- f/19, ISO 100, Handheld Micro flash: The one with the black background. 1/200 sec, f/32  To get the sharpest image in the micro area, I use Live View and zoom in as much as possible and then focus on the eyes. (which is quite a challenge when shooting handheld and in the bright sun)  #MyPhotography #RSphotography #Dragonfly #IrchelParkï»¿"
